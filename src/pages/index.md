        Our tags are linked to non-fungible-tokens (NFTs) hence allowing the owners of the product to tokenize their items on crosschain platforms such as Solona, Ethereum, and Polygon. Once created they cannot be destroyed, and users with wallets can buy and trade these unique NFTs as real life transactions with the products are made. This allows the collection and tracking of data in real time.
