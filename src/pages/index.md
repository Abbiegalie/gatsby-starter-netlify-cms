        is added, allowing seamless two way communcation between any user with a

        Our tags are linked to non-fungible-tokens (NFTs) hence allowing the
        owners of the product to tokenize their items on crosschain platforms
        such as Solona, Ethereum, and Polygon. Once created they cannot be
        destroyed, and users with wallets can buy and trade these unique NFTs as
        real life transactions with the products are made. This allows the
        collection and tracking of data in real time.

    We hold our coffee to the highest standards from the shrub to the cup.
    That’s why we’re meticulous and transparent about each step of the coffee’s
    journey. We personally visit each farm to make sure the conditions are
    optimal for the plants, farmers and the local environment.
